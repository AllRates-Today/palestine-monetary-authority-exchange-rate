**Official Palestine Monetary Authority (Palestine) daily exchange rates for Node.js and TypeScript. The published central bank rates behind tax filings, customs valuations, audits, and compliant invoicing — not market estimates, but the numbers Palestine Monetary Authority itself prints, every business day.**

## 🚀 Why this client?

- 🏛️ **Official published rates** — Palestine Monetary Authority's own table, with the publisher's own `rate_date` on every response
- 📅 **History from 2026** — this source publishes only its current table, so the archive builds forward from the day we started collecting
- 🔀 **Published vs derived, always flagged** — computed inverse/cross pairs carry `derived: true`, never mixed with official prints
- ⚡ **Zero dependencies** — pure ESM + CJS over global `fetch`; Node 18+, Bun, Deno, and edge runtimes
- 🔷 **Type-safe** — full TypeScript definitions shipped with the package
- 🧾 **Compliance-grade metadata** — `rate_type`, publication date, and source disclaimer on every response

> **Official rate, not mid-market:** every value here is a number Palestine Monetary Authority itself published, fixed once printed and carrying the central bank's own `rate_date` — what filings and audits require. Need the live interbank midpoint for pricing or display instead? Use the [mid-market API](https://allratestoday.com/docs/) or [`@allratestoday/sdk`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/@allratestoday/sdk). The two can diverge by several percent.

## ⚡ Try it without a key

The latest Palestine Monetary Authority table is also served keyless, CORS-open and edge-cached, for evaluation, embeds and AI agents:

```bash
curl "https://allratestoday.com/api/open/central-bank/pma?source=USD&target=ILS"
```

```js
const r = await fetch('https://allratestoday.com/api/open/central-bank/pma').then((x) => x.json());
console.log(r.rate_date, r.rates.length); // the central bank's latest published table, no key
```

The open endpoint serves the *latest* table only and asks for a visible attribution link. The client below uses the keyed API, which adds point-in-time tables, history, and CSV/XML/Excel output.

---

### Latest pair rate

Free plan and up. Pairs the central bank does not print directly are resolved from its table and flagged (see *Published vs derived rates* below).

```js
const pair = await getRate('USD', 'ILS', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'pma',
  name: 'Palestine Monetary Authority',
  rate_date: '2026-09-09',   // Palestine Monetary Authority's own publication date
  source: 'USD',
  target: 'ILS',
  rate: 3.0166,
  rate_type: 'sell',
  derived: false,
  method: 'published',
  disclaimer: 'Official rates as published by the named central bank. On weekends/holidays the most recent published rate_date is returned.'
}
```

### Full published table

Free plan and up. The complete table for the latest publication date.

```js
import { getLatestRates } from 'palestine-monetary-authority-exchange-rate';

const table = await getLatestRates({ apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
console.log(table.rate_date, table.rates.length);
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'pma',
  name: 'Palestine Monetary Authority',
  rate_date: '2026-09-09',
  rates: [
    { "base": "USD", "quote": "ILS", "type": "sell", "value": 3.0166 },
    { "base": "USD", "quote": "ILS", "type": "buy", "value": 3.0134 },
    // … the rest of the published table (4 currencies vs ILS)
  ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

### Table for a date

Paid plans. The official table for any date since 2026 — weekends and holidays return the most recent published date, flagged via `published_on_requested_date`, which is exactly the in-force rate a filing needs.

```js
import { getRatesForDate } from 'palestine-monetary-authority-exchange-rate';

const day = await getRatesForDate('2026-06-30', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
// Optionally narrow to one pair:
const one = await getRatesForDate('2026-06-30', { apiKey: 'art_live_...', source: 'USD', target: 'ILS' });
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'pma',
  requested_date: '2026-06-30',
  rate_date: '2026-06-30',                // the date actually published
  published_on_requested_date: true,      // false when a weekend/holiday fell back
  rates: [ /* the full table for that date */ ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

### Daily time series

Paid plans. One resolved rate per publication date — ready for charting, revaluation runs, or audit workpapers.

```js
import { getHistory } from 'palestine-monetary-authority-exchange-rate';

const series = await getHistory(
  { source: 'USD', target: 'ILS', from: '2026-01-01', to: '2026-09-09' },
  { apiKey: 'art_live_...' }
);
```

**Response:**

```javascript
{
  bank: 'pma',
  source: 'USD',
  target: 'ILS',
  from: '2026-01-01',
  to: '2026-09-09',
  count: 152,
  rates: [
    // one entry per publication date
    { date: '2026-09-09', rate: 3.0166, rate_type: 'sell', derived: false, method: 'published' },
    // …
  ],
  disclaimer: '…'
}
```

Pass `{ symbol: 'USD' }` instead of `source`/`target` to get the raw published rows for one currency (all rate types, no pair resolution).

## 🗺️ Currencies covered

Palestine Monetary Authority currently publishes rates covering **4 currencies** against the ILS (as of the latest table):

🇪🇬 `EGP` · 🇪🇺 `EUR` · 🇯🇴 `JOD` · 🇺🇸 `USD`

## 🏛️ Source

The Palestine Monetary Authority publishes daily buying and selling rates for the currencies that actually circulate in Palestine — the US dollar, Jordanian dinar, euro and Egyptian pound — quoted in Israeli new shekels, since Palestine issues no currency of its own. The bulletin is the official local reference for pricing and settlement across the three currencies in everyday use.

- Publisher's own page: [Exchange rates](https://www.pma.ps/en/exchange-rates-live) · [www.pma.ps](https://www.pma.ps)
- Publication: every business day; the exact schedule, freshness status and any current delay are on the [Palestine Monetary Authority rates page](https://allratestoday.com/central-bank-rates-api/pma/)
- Values are stored unmodified, with the publisher's own `rate_date` on every row — see the [methodology](https://allratestoday.com/official-rates-methodology/)

## 🧭 Reading the numbers

- `value` is always **quote currency per 1 unit of base currency** (`base: "EUR", quote: "USD", value: 1.15` means 1 EUR = 1.15 USD).
- Palestine Monetary Authority quotes **ILS per 1 unit of foreign currency** (e.g. `base: "USD", quote: "ILS"` means ILS per one US dollar).
- Need the other way round? Ask `getRate(target, source)` and the API inverts or crosses for you, flagged `derived: true` — never divide a published rate yourself in a compliance workflow.
- `rate_type` tells you which of the central bank's series a row belongs to (`sell` here); some publishers print buy/sell or several fixings for the same pair.

## 🧩 ERP & accounting systems

Loading the official Palestine Monetary Authority rate into an accounting system is a supported workflow, not a hack. Step-by-step guides with the direction each system expects:

- [Dynamics 365 Business Central](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/business-central/) — built-in Currency Exchange Rate Service, no code
- [Xero](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/xero/) · [QuickBooks Online](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/quickbooks/) · [SAP S/4HANA and ECC](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/sap/) · [Odoo](https://allratestoday.com/docs/integrations/odoo/)

The same keyed endpoints return `?format=csv`, `?format=xml` and `?format=xlsx`, and accept the key as `?api_key=` on the URL for importers that cannot send headers:

```bash
curl "https://allratestoday.com/api/v1/central-bank/pma/latest?format=xml&api_key=art_live_..."
```

## ⚖️ Published vs derived rates

If Palestine Monetary Authority does not print a pair directly, the API resolves it from the central bank's own table and says so — official and computed values are never confused:

| `method` | `derived` | Meaning |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `published` | `false` | The central bank printed this pair directly |
| `inverse` | `true` | Computed as 1 ÷ the published opposite direction |
| `cross` | `true` | Computed via ILS from two published rates |

## 🛡️ Error handling

Errors are thrown as `Error` with `status` (HTTP code) and `body` (the API's JSON error) attached:

```js
try {
  const pair = await getRate('USD', 'XXX', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' });
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err.message); // human-readable reason
  console.log(err.status);  // e.g. 404
}
```

| Status | Meaning |
| ------ | ------- |
| — | Missing `apiKey` (thrown before any request) |
| `400` | Malformed date or parameters |
| `401` | Invalid API key |
| `403` | Endpoint needs a [paid plan](https://allratestoday.com/pricing/) (historical dates & series) |
| `404` | Pair or date range not covered by Palestine Monetary Authority |
| `429` | Monthly quota exceeded |

## 🔷 TypeScript

Full definitions ship with the package — no `@types` install:

```ts
import type { LatestRates, PairRate, DatedRates, RateEntry, HistoryQuery, RequestOptions } from 'palestine-monetary-authority-exchange-rate';
```

## 📦 CommonJS

```javascript
const { getRate } = require('palestine-monetary-authority-exchange-rate');

getRate('USD', 'ILS', { apiKey: 'art_live_...' }).then((pair) => console.log(pair.rate));
```

## 💡 Quota tips

- Rates change once per business day — cache the published table locally and a small monthly quota goes a long way.
- Every request counts toward your AllRatesToday quota, shared across all AllRatesToday endpoints on your key.
